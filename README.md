# Quanda - An ASP.NET Core Razor Pages Concept Application

For the April 2020 Memphis .NET User Group, I led a virtual workshop about ASP.NET Core Razor Pages. The demo application is called **Quanda**. It's a Stack Overflow inspired question and answer site. Thus the name **Qu**estion **and** **a**nswer. Anonymous users can view and search questions by tag. Registered and authenticated users can create new questions, answer existing questions and upvote one answer per question. They can also edit and delete the questions they create.
